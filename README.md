# pycopy
A couple of scripts for copying and pasting files between terminals

I haven't gotten around to creating a setup.py,
so for now just make symlinks to pycopy.py and pypaste.py.

Example:
  From a directory call <code> pycopy doc1.txt doc2.txt </code> <br>
  From an another directory call <code>pypaste</code>, and the last files copied will be pasted.
